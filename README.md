Features include:
- Two different weapons, laser weapon and homing missile.
- Weapon pickup that unlocks homing missile when flying over pickup.
- Enemy spawn system that spawns enemies at random spots around the player with a set cooldown.
- Enemies follow player and shoot player with laser weapon.
- Shield that has a certain amount of hitpoints, when destroyed it will regenerate automatically after a set interval.
- If enemy/player collide with something with enough force, damage will be applied, determined by the impact force. If enough force is applied, the character will die instantly.
- Explosions when character gets hit/dies.
- Solar system background with orbiting planets and spinning galaxies.

I am quite happy with how the game is at the moment, I would've really liked to have added sounds. If I work on it more, that's what I'll add.
The weapon system is what I'm most happy with since it can be infinitely expandable, you can add more weapons using the IWeapon interface without really changing anything.
